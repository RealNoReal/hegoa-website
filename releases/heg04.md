“Jaikiera” by Verde Prato recovers Basque oral tradition through modern lenses. Ana Arsuaga’s reverb-soaked drum machines and synths transform traditional folk stories into dreamy, ethereal pop songs. Recorded after her acclaimed debut, this two-song 7" is a haunting continuation of her exploration of Basque heritage.
