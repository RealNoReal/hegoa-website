ol uz "ol uz" (heg05) - september 2022

![OL UZ](../public/assets/Heg05_A.webp)

OL UZ project was recorded in October 2021, inside a water tank at a macro housing development abandoned in 2011 in Manduliz, close to Bilbao's airport.
     A 500+ housing plan including a golf club and a retail park turned into a "Chernobyl", after it was dumped half way through its construction, it's now the layout for this two Basque improvisers to put together a bold recital with just two instruments.

     What you find in this box is Ibon Rodriguez and Luis Andr√©'s free acoustic improvisation in 12 movements for trumpet, voice and water tank recorded with 5 microphones. Box includes leaves picked up onsite and dried after wildlife has taken over the space, and a booklet including pictures of the area and its surroundings.
