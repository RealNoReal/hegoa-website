“F(r)icciones is a complicated
     piece of miscellaneous works. A set
     of experiments in preparation for a
     gig at a noise convention in Orozco
     that never happened, an 18 women
     choir piece composed for a
     soundtrack to a documentary that
     doesn’t have a release date yet or
     trying to create a drone piece by
     accumulating guitar noise. The
     result? Burnt psychedelic blues
     with electronics ”

     Partly an official soundtrack to
     “Durangas”, a documentary focusing
     on women and heritage, discussing
     civil war, education, sex or
     violence in the town of Durango,
     Basque Country. And partly a non
     musical accompaniment to an
     imaginary movie, F(r)icciones is
     the new album by A. Maiah.

     Self described as Guitarist /
     Composer / Improviser of
     Idiomatic Noise / Microtonal
     Blues Ist or Psychedelic
     Populist, Asier has been
     self-releasing albums for nearly a
     decade now, focusing mostly on
     prepared guitar or improvised
     noise.

     Durangas was composed by Asier,
     arranged/conducted by Garazi
     Navas, performed by an 18 women
     choir from Durango and recorded
     live at San Agustin Cultural
     Centre. All of the other tracks
     were recorded between 2021-2022 in
     between portable recorders in
     Burgos or at Estudios Nomadas.
