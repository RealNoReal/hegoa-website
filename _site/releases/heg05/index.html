<p>ol uz &quot;ol uz&quot; (heg05) - september 2022</p>
<p><img src="../public/assets/Heg05_A.webp" alt="OL UZ"></p>
<p>OL UZ project was recorded in October 2021, inside a water tank at a macro housing development abandoned in 2011 in Manduliz, close to Bilbao's airport.
A 500+ housing plan including a golf club and a retail park turned into a &quot;Chernobyl&quot;, after it was dumped half way through its construction, it's now the layout for this two Basque improvisers to put together a bold recital with just two instruments.</p>
<p>What you find in this box is Ibon Rodriguez and Luis André's free acoustic improvisation in 12 movements for trumpet, voice and water tank recorded with 5 microphones. Box includes leaves picked up onsite and dried after wildlife has taken over the space, and a booklet including pictures of the area and its surroundings.</p>
