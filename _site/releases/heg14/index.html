<p>This is a compilation of recordings made at different stages in Jmur’s life. The first section takes us from what could have been a private pressed loner folk piece recorded in Denver, Colorado in 1979, straight into a passage from a somewhat imaginary sci-fi planet from a 70’s B-movie. Acoustic folk merges into cosmic new age and lands into psych pop. Nostalgic spacy lullabies meet beloved diy pop dreams that become part of that pastoral landscape that has always existed somewhere in your memory. The record navigates that trend with ease, jumping from South American infused guitar tones into space ambient, to meet us halfway with a My Bloody Valentine cover from your wonky average school band. The teen spirit is still alive!</p>
<p>Born in Hendaye, France, Josemari Unanue &quot;Jmur&quot; developed an early interest in music. He gave his first concert at age 13 as a keyboardist for Os Gallardos, his father's blues band. Quickly after that he bought his first recorder and began writing and developing his own compositions. In 2017, he joined the band &quot;SILENCE&quot; and later on, influenced by DIY/lo-fi aesthetics, he self-produced &quot;The First Steps of the Morning&quot;, an LP under the pseudonym &quot;Soma Cult,&quot; which would later become a band. Since 2020, together with Andrea Pozo, he has been involved in the project &quot;Ramona's First Evil Boyfriend,&quot; with a self-titled debut album followed by a second LP Mnemosyne.</p>
<p>In 2023, he made the documentary &quot;Burrundaie: Stories of the First Rock of Urola,&quot; in which, through interviews and archival footage, he shines a light on how the first rock bands from Azkoitia and Azpeitia were created in the 1970s and 1980s. Find out more on @burrundaie.docu (IG), an archive where he recovers audiovisual material from the era.</p>
